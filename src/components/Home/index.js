        known as the Land Of Safaris. Millions of wildebeests and other ungulates traverse this land during
        their great migration. They cross from here to Maasai Mara every year. This is called a Great
        Migration. And during the month of Feb on the plains of Ndutu, these animals give birth to millions
        of calves. It is a truly a sight to watch.
